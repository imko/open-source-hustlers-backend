# OpenSourceHustlers (Backend) 

## What is OpenSourceHustlers? 
OpenSourceHustlers is a web application designed to make collaboration easier among developers in the open source community. 

By allowing users to create posts about their open source projects, the platform connects individuals with similar interests and work experience, promoting confidence and experience in contributing to larger open source projects. 

Our goal is to promote best practices in open source contribution and provide a supportive environment for beginner developers to start their journey in open source projects. Additionally, the platform fetches and serves open source projects from GitHub with tags suitable for beginner developers or featuring good first issues, further enhancing opportunities for involvement and learning in software development.

## Features
